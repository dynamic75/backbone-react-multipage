    <p> Here we instanciate a view within a view. The QuizView javascript is instanciated on Hannibal and Breaking Bad.
        The instanciation happens when the app starts.</p>

    <p>Just take note that we never pass in data at the time of instanciation because state data is not present during
        the initialize phase.  Instead pass it in during render() or processRouteChange()</p>

    <p>This nested QuizView is simple and does not save its state when changing away to another page. For that example see the
        nested views on Firelfy</p>
